### Unit 4 project reflection
I wish to learn more about LCD displays next time. 
I've focused on sound to indicate the distance the ultrasonic sensor detects, but it would be helpful to get specific distances to replicate real-life situations.
The project I worked on can eventually become a component of a underwater robot explorer or a rover, so it would be helpful getting specific distances for research purposes and identifying the enviornment.
